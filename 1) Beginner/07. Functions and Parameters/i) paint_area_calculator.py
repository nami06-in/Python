    You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall.
    Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

    number of cans = (wall height x wall width) รท coverage per can.
    e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5
    number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5
                   = 1.6
    But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.

    ceil() in math library can be used to find nearest whole number.
